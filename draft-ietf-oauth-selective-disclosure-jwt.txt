1.  Introduction

   The JSON-based representation of claims in a signed JSON Web Token
   (JWT) [RFC7519] is secured against modification using JSON Web
   Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] digital signatures.  A consumer of a signed
   JWT that has checked the signature can safely assume that the
   contents of the token have not been modified.  However, anyone
   receiving an unencrypted JWT can read all of the claims and likewise,
   anyone with the decryption key receiving an encrypted JWT can also
   read all of the claims.

   One of the common use cases of a signed JWT is representing a user's
   identity.  As long as the signed JWT is one-time use, it typically
   only contains those claims the user has consented to disclose to a
   specific Verifier.  However, there is an increasing number of use
   cases where a signed JWT is created once and then used a number of
   times by the user (the "Holder" of the JWT).  In such cases, the
   signed JWT needs to contain the superset of all claims the user of
   the signed JWT might want to disclose to Verifiers at some point.
   The ability to selectively disclose a subset of these claims
   depending on the Verifier becomes crucial to ensure minimum
   disclosure and prevent Verifiers from obtaining claims irrelevant for
   the transaction at hand.

   One example of such a multi-use JWT is a verifiable credential, a
   tamper-evident credential with a cryptographically verifiable
   authorship that contains claims about a subject.  SD-JWTs defined in
   this document enable such selective disclosure of claims.

   In an SD-JWT, claims can be hidden, but cryptographically protected
   against undetected modification.  When issuing the SD-JWT to the
   Holder, the Issuer also sends the cleartext counterparts of all
   hidden claims, the so-called Disclosures, separate from the SD-JWT
   itself.

   The Holder decides which claims to disclose to a Verifier and
   forwards the respective Disclosures together with the SD-JWT to the
   Verifier.  The Verifier has to verify that all disclosed claim values
   were part of the original, Issuer-signed SD-JWT.  The Verifier will
   not, however, learn any claim values not disclosed in the
   Disclosures.

   While JWTs for claims describing natural persons are a common use
   case, the mechanisms defined in this document can be used for many
   other use cases as well.

   This document also describes an optional mechanism for Holder
   Binding, or the concept of binding an SD-JWT to key material
   controlled by the Holder.  The strength of the Holder Binding is
   conditional upon the trust in the protection of the private key of
   the key pair an SD-JWT is bound to.

   This specification aims to be easy to implement and to leverage
   established and widely used data formats and cryptographic algorithms
   wherever possible.

1.1.  Feature Summary

   *  This specification defines

      -  a format enabling selective disclosure for JWTs,

      -  formats for associated data that enables disclosing claims, and

      -  formats for the combined transport of SD-JWTs and the
         associated data.

   *  The specification supports selectively disclosable claims in flat
      data structures as well as more complex, nested data structures.

   *  This specification enables combining selectively disclosable
      claims with clear-text claims that are always disclosed.

   *  For selectively disclosable claims, claim names are always
      blinded.

1.2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *base64url* denotes the URL-safe base64 encoding without padding
   defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515].

2.  Terms and Definitions

   Selective disclosure:  Process of a Holder disclosing to a Verifier a
      subset of claims contained in a claim set issued by an Issuer.

   Selectively Disclosable JWT (SD-JWT):  An Issuer-created signed JWT
      (JWS, [RFC7515]) that supports selective disclosure as defined in
      this document and can contain both regular claims and digests of
      selectively-disclosable claims.

   Disclosure:  A combination of a salt, a cleartext claim name, and a
      cleartext claim value that is used to calculate a digest for a
      certain claim.

   Cryptographic Holder Binding:  Ability of the Holder to prove
      legitimate possession of an SD-JWT by proving control over the
      same private key during the issuance and presentation.  An SD-JWT
      with Holder Binding contains a public key or a reference to a
      public key that matches to the private key controlled by the
      Holder.

   Issuer:  An entity that creates SD-JWTs.

   Holder:  An entity that received SD-JWTs from the Issuer and has
      control over them.

   Verifier:  An entity that requests, checks and extracts the claims
      from an SD-JWT and respective Disclosures.

   Note: discuss if we want to include Client, Authorization Server for
   the purpose of ensuring continuity and separating the entity from the
   actor.

4.  Concepts

   In the following, the contents of SD-JWTs and Disclosures are
   described at a conceptual level, abstracting from the data formats
   described afterwards.

4.1.  Creating an SD-JWT

   An SD-JWT, at its core, is a digitally signed document containing
   digests over the claims (per claim: a random salt, the claim name and
   the claim value).  It MAY further contain clear-text claims that are
   always disclosed to the Verifier.  It MUST be digitally signed using
   the Issuer's private key.

   SD-JWT-DOC = (METADATA, SD-CLAIMS, NON-SD-CLAIMS)
   SD-JWT = SD-JWT-DOC | SIG(SD-JWT-DOC, ISSUER-PRIV-KEY)

   SD-CLAIMS is an object with claim names (CLAIM-NAME) mapped to the
   digests over the claim values (CLAIM-VALUE) with random salts (SALT).
   Digests are calculated using a digest derivation function such as a
   hash function, HMAC, or other (DIGEST-DERIVATION()):

   SD-CLAIMS = (
       DIGEST-DERIVATION(SALT, CLAIM-NAME, CLAIM-VALUE)
   )*

   When an HMAC or another type of derivation function is used for
   digest calculation, a secret cryptographic key or other cryptographic
   secret is used instead of a salt value.  However, the term "salt" is
   used throughout this document for brevity.

   SD-CLAIMS can also be nested deeper to capture more complex objects,
   as will be shown later.

   SD-JWT is sent from the Issuer to the Holder, together with the
   mapping of the plain-text claim values, the salt values, and
   potentially some other information.

   The Issuer further creates a set of Disclosures for all claims in the
   SD-JWT.  The Disclosures are sent to the Holder together with the SD-
   JWT:

   DISCLOSURES = (
       (SALT, CLAIM-NAME, CLAIM-VALUE)
   )*

   The SD-JWT and the Disclosures are sent to the Holder by the Issuer:

   COMBINED-ISSUANCE = SD-JWT | DISCLOSURES

4.2.  Creating Holder-Selected Disclosures

   To disclose to a Verifier a subset of the SD-JWT claim values, a
   Holder selects a subset of the Disclosures and sends it to the
   Verifier along with the SD-JWT.

   HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES = (
       (SALT, CLAIM-NAME, CLAIM-VALUE)
   )*

   COMBINED-PRESENTATION = SD-JWT | HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES

4.3.  Optional Holder Binding

   Some use-cases may require Holder Binding.

   Cryptographic Holder Binding is an optional feature, but when it is
   desired, SD-JWT must contain information about key material
   controlled by the Holder:

   SD-JWT-DOC = (METADATA, HOLDER-PUBLIC-KEY, SD-CLAIMS, NON-SD-CLAIMS)

   Note: How the public key is included in SD-JWT is out of scope of
   this document.  It can be passed by value or by reference.

   The Holder can then create a signed document HOLDER-BINDING-JWT using
   its private key.  This document contains some data provided by the
   Verifier (out of scope of this document) to ensure the freshness of
   the signature, for example, a nonce and an indicator of the intended
   audience for the document.

   HOLDER-BINDING-JWT-DOC = (NONCE, AUDIENCE)
   HOLDER-BINDING-JWT = HOLDER-BINDING-JWT-DOC |
       SIG(HOLDER-BINDING-JWT-DOC, HOLDER-PRIV-KEY)

   The Holder Binding JWT is sent to the Verifier along with the SD-JWT
   and the Holder-Selected Disclosures.

COMBINED-PRESENTATION = SD-JWT | HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES | HOLDER-BINDING-JWT

   Note that there may be other ways to send the Holder Binding JWT to
   the Verifier or to prove Holder Binding.  In these cases, inclusion
   of the Holder Binding JWT in the COMBINED-PRESENTATION is not
   required.

4.4.  Verifying Holder-Selected Disclosures

   At a high level, the Verifier

   *  receives the COMBINED-PRESENTATION from the Holder and verifies
      the signature of the SD-JWT using the Issuer's public key,

   *  verifies the Holder Binding JWT, if Holder Binding is required by
      the Verifier's policy, using the public key included in the SD-
      JWT,

   *  calculates the hash digests over the Holder-Selected Disclosures
      and verifies that each digest is contained in the SD-JWT.

   The detailed algorithm is described in Section 6.2.

5.  Data Formats

   This section defines data formats for SD-JWTs, Disclosures, Holder
   Binding JWTs and formats for combining these elements for transport.

5.1.  The Challenge of Canonicalization

   When receiving an SD-JWT with associated Disclosures, a Verifier must
   be able to re-compute digests of the disclosed claim values and,
   given the same input values, obtain the same digest values as signed
   by the Issuer.

   Usually, JSON-based formats transport claim values as simple
   properties of a JSON object such as this:

   ...
     "family_name": "Möbius",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
       "locality": "Schulpforta"
     }
   ...

   However, a problem arises when computation over the data need to be
   performed and verified, like signing or computing digests.  Common
   signature schemes require the same byte string as input to the
   signature verification as was used for creating the signature.  In
   the digest derivation approach outlined above, the same problem
   exists: for the Issuer and the Verifier to arrive at the same digest,
   the same byte string must be hashed.

   JSON [RFC7159], however, does not prescribe a unique encoding for
   data, but allows for variations in the encoded string.  The data
   above, for example, can be encoded as

   ...
   "family_name": "M\u00f6bius",
   "address": {
     "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
     "locality": "Schulpforta"
   }
   ...

   or as

  ...
  "family_name": "Möbius",
  "address": {"locality":"Schulpforta", "street_address":"Schulstr. 12"}
  ...

   The two representations "M\u00f6bius" and "M&#246;bius" are very
   different on the byte-level, but yield equivalent objects.  Same for
   the representations of address, varying in white space and order of
   elements in the object.

   The variations in white space, ordering of object properties, and
   encoding of Unicode characters are all allowed by the JSON
   specification, including further variations, e.g., concerning
   floating-point numbers, as described in [RFC8785].  Variations can be
   introduced whenever JSON data is serialized or deserialized and
   unless dealt with, will lead to different digests and the inability
   to verify signatures.

   There are generally two approaches to deal with this problem:

   1.  Canonicalization: The data is transferred in JSON format,
       potentially introducing variations in its representation, but is
       transformed into a canonical form before computing a digest.
       Both the Issuer and the Verifier must use the same
       canonicalization algorithm to arrive at the same byte string for
       computing a digest.

   2.  Source string hardening: Instead of transferring data in a format
       that may introduce variations, a representation of the data is
       serialized.  This representation is then used as the digest input
       at the Verifier, but also transferred to the Verifier and used
       for the same digest calculcation there.  This means that the
       Verifier can easily check the digest over the byte string before
       finally deserializing and accessing the data.

   Mixed approaches are conceivable, i.e., transferring both the
   original JSON data plus a string suitable for computing a digest, but
   such approaches can easily lead to undetected inconsistencies
   resulting in time-of-check-time-of-use type security vulnerabilities.

   In this specification, the source string hardening approach is used,
   as it allows for simple and reliable interoperability without the
   requirement for a canonicalization library.  To harden the source
   string, any serialization format that supports the necessary data
   types could be used in theory, like protobuf, msgpack, or pickle.  In
   this specification, JSON is used and plain text values of each
   Disclosure is encoded using base64url-encoding for transport.  This
   approach means that SD-JWTs can be implemented purely based on widely
   available JWT, JSON, and Base64 encoding and decoding libraries.

   A Verifier can then easily check the digest over the source string
   before extracting the original JSON data.  Variations in the encoding
   of the source string are implicitly tolerated by the Verifier, as the
   digest is computed over a predefined byte string and not over a JSON
   object.

   It is important to note that the Disclosures are neither intended nor
   suitable for direct consumption by an application that needs to
   access the disclosed claim values after the verification by the
   Verifier.  The Disclosures are only intended to be used by a Verifier
   to check the digests over the source strings and to extract the
   original JSON data.  The original JSON data is then used by the
   application.  See Section 6.2 for details.

5.2.  Format of an SD-JWT

   An SD-JWT is a JWT that MUST be signed using the Issuer's private
   key.  The payload of an SD-JWT MUST contain the
   sd_digest_derivation_alg claim described in the following, MAY
   contain one or more selectively disclosable claims, and MAY contain a
   Holder's public key or a reference thereto, as well as further claims
   such as iss, iat, etc. as defined or required by the application
   using SD-JWTs.

5.2.1.  Selectively Disclosable Claims

   For each claim that is to be selectively disclosed, the Issuer
   creates a Disclosure, hashes it, and includes the hash instead of the
   original claim in the SD-JWT, as described next.  The Disclosures are
   then sent to the Holder.

5.2.1.1.  Creating Disclosures

   The Issuer MUST create a Disclosure for each selectively disclosable
   claim as follows:

   *  Create an array of three elements in this order:

      1.  A salt value.  See Section 7.4 and Section 7.5 for security
          considerations.  The salt value MUST be unique for each claim
          that is to be selectively disclosed.  It is RECOMMENDED to
          base64url-encode the salt value, producing a string.  Any
          other type that is allowed in JSON MAY be used, e.g., a
          number.

      2.  The claim name, or key, as it would be used in a regular JWT
          body.  This MUST be a string.

      3.  The claim's value, as it would be used in a regular JWT body.
          The value MAY be of any type that is allowed in JSON,
          including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.

   *  JSON-encode the array such that an UTF-8 string is produced.

   *  base64url-encode the byte representation of the UTF-8 string,
      producing a US-ASCII [RFC0020] string.  This string is the
      Disclosure.

   The order is decided based on the readability considerations: salts
   would have a constant length within the SD-JWT, claim names would be
   around the same length all the time, and claim values would vary in
   size, potentially being large objects.

   The following example illustrates the steps described above.

   The array is created as follows:

   ["6qMQvRL5haj", "family_name", "Möbius"]

   The resulting Disclosure would be
   WyI2cU1RdlJMNWhhaiIsICJmYW1pbHlfbmFtZSIsICJNw7ZiaXVzIl0.

   Note that the JSON encoding of the object is not canonicalized, so
   variations in white space, encoding of Unicode characters, and
   ordering of object properties are allowed.  For example, the
   following strings are all valid and encode the same claim value:

   *  A different way to encode the umlaut (two dots &#168; placed over
      the letter):
      WyI2cU1RdlJMNWhhaiIsICJmYW1pbHlfbmFtZSIsICJNXHUwMGY2Yml1cyJd

   *  No white space:
      WyI2cU1RdlJMNWhhaiIsImZhbWlseV9uYW1lIiwiTcO2Yml1cyJd

   *  Newline characters between elements:
      WwoiNnFNUXZSTDVoYWoiLAoiZmFtaWx5X25hbWUiLAoiTcO2Yml1cyIKXQ

5.2.1.2.  Hashing Disclosures

   For embedding the Disclosures in the SD-JWT, the Disclosures are
   hashed using the digest algorithm specified in the
   sd_digest_derivation_alg claim described below.  The resulting hash
   is then included in the SD-JWT instead of the original claim value,
   as described next.

   The hash digest MUST be taken over the US-ASCII bytes of the
   base64url-encoded Disclosure.  This follows the convention in JWS
   [RFC7515] and JWE [RFC7516].  The bytes of the hash digest MUST then
   be base64url-encoded.

   It is important to note that:

   *  The input to the hash function is the base64url-encoded
      Disclosure, not the bytes encoded by the base64url string.

   *  The bytes of the output of the hash function are base64url-
      encoded, not the bytes making up the (often used) hex
      representation of the bytes of the hash digest.

   For example, the SHA-256 hash digest of the Disclosure
   WyI2cU1RdlJMNWhhaiIsICJmYW1pbHlfbmFtZSIsICJNw7ZiaXVzIl0 would be
   uutlBuYeMDyjLLTpf6Jxi7yNkEF35jdyWMn9U7b_RYY.

5.2.1.3.  Decoy Digests

   An Issuer MAY add additional hash digests to the SD-JWT that are not
   associated with any claim.  The purpose of such "decoy" digests is to
   make it more difficult for an attacker to see the original number of
   claims contained in the SD-JWT.  It is RECOMMENDED to create the
   decoy digests by hashing over a cryptographically secure random
   number.  The bytes of the hash digest MUST then be base64url-encoded
   as above.  The same digest function as for the Disclosures MUST be
   used.

   For decoy digests, no Disclosure is sent to the Holder, i.e., the
   Holder will see hash digests that do not correspond to any
   Disclosure.  See Section 8.1 for additional privacy considerations.

   To ensure readability and replicability, the examples in this
   specification do not contain decoy digests unless explicitly stated.

5.2.1.4.  Creating an SD-JWT

   An SD-JWT is a JWT that MUST be signed using the Issuer's private
   key.

   An SD-JWT MAY contain both selectively disclosable claims and non-
   selectively disclosable claims, i.e., claims that are always
   contained in the SD-JWT in plaintext and are always visible to a
   Verifier.

   It is the Issuer who decides which claims are selectively disclosable
   and which are not.  However, claims controlling the validity of the
   SD-JWT, such as iss, exp, or nbf are usually included in plaintext.
   End-User claims MAY be included as plaintext as well, e.g., if hiding
   the particular claims from the Verifier does not make sense in the
   intended use case.

   Claims that are not selectively disclosable are included in the SD-
   JWT in plaintext just as they would be in any other JWT.

   Selectively disclosable claims are omitted from the SD-JWT.  Instead,
   the hash digests of the respective Disclosures and potentially decoy
   digests are contained as an array in a new JWT claim, _sd.

   The _sd claim MUST be an array of strings, each string being a hash
   digests of a Disclosure or a decoy digest as described above.  The
   array MAY be empty in case the Issuer decided not to selectively
   disclose any of the claims at that level.  However, it is RECOMMENDED
   to omit _sd claim in this case to save space.

   The Issuer MUST hide the original order of the claims in the array.
   To ensure this, it is RECOMMENDED to shuffle the array of hashes,
   e.g., by sorting it alphanumerically or randomly.  The precise method
   does not matter as long as it does not depend on the original order
   of elements.

   Issuers MUST NOT issue SD-JWTs where

   *  the key _sd is already used for the purpose other than to contain
      the array of hash digests, or

   *  the claim value contained in a Disclosure contains (at the top
      level or nested deeper) an object with an _sd key, or

   *  the same Disclosure value appears more than once (in the same
      array or in different arrays).

5.2.1.5.  Nested Data in SD-JWTs

   Just like any JWT, an SD-JWT MAY contain key value pairs where the
   value is an object.  For any object in an SD-JWT, the Issuer MAY
   decide to either make the entire object selectively disclosable or to
   make its properties selectively disclosable individually.  In the
   latter case, the Issuer MAY even choose to make some some of the
   object's properties selectively disclosable and others not.

   In any case, the _sd claim MUST be included in the SD-JWT at the same
   level as the original claim and therefore MAY appear multiple times
   in an SD-JWT.

   The following examples show some of the options an Issuer has when
   producing an SD-JWT with the following End-User data.

   {
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
       "locality": "Schulpforta",
       "region": "Sachsen-Anhalt",
       "country": "DE"
     }
   }

   Important: Throughout the examples in this document, line breaks had
   to be added to JSON strings and base64-encoded strings (as shown in
   the next example) to adhere to the 72 character limit for lines in
   RFCs and for readability.  JSON does not allow line breaks in
   strings.

5.2.1.5.1.  Option 1: Flat SD-JWT

   The Issuer can decide to treat the address claim as a block that can
   either be disclosed completely or not at all.  The following example
   shows that in this case, the entire address claim is treated as an
   object in the Disclosure.

   {
     "_sd": [
       "vNhbLbXx6SFqIJZn5lNXyrASjpaXGUT2uNGuy_gSMbw"
     ],
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1516239022,
     "exp": 1516247022,
     "sd_digest_derivation_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   The Issuer would create the following Disclosure:

   *Disclosure for address:*

   SHA-256 Hash: vNhbLbXx6SFqIJZn5lNXyrASjpaXGUT2uNGuy_gSMbw

5.2.1.5.2.  Option 2: Structured SD-JWT

   The Issuer may instead decide to make the address claim contents
   selectively disclosable individually:

   {
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address": {
       "_sd": [
         "7pHe1uQ5uSClgAxXdG0E6dKnBgXcxEO1zvoQO9E5Lr4",
         "9-VdSnvRTZNDo-4Bxcp3X-V9VtLOCRUkR6oLWZQl81I",
         "nTzPZ3Q68z1Ko_9ao9LK0mSYXY5gY6UG6KEkQ_BdqU0",

     "exp": 1516247022,
     "sd_digest_derivation_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   In this case, the Issuer would use the following data in the
   Disclosures for the address sub-claims:

   *Disclosure for street_address:*

5.2.1.5.3.  Option 3: Structured SD-JWT, only some properties
            selectively disclosable

   The Issuer may also make one sub-claim of address non-selectively
   disclosable and hide only the other sub-claims:

   {
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "address": {
       "_sd": [
         "ToD9fSNGo_SOCnTM0r0AaGjdHEIh4doXinCkKjR2fk4",
         "bIPnfvtg9QQSGd7W9srnYOVTK-sNUFz9kr1Js7XaU4E",

     "exp": 1516247022,
     "sd_digest_derivation_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   In this case, the Issuer would issue the following Disclosures:

   *Disclosure for street_address:*

5.2.2.  Digest Derivation Function Claim

   The claim sd_digest_derivation_alg indicates the digest derivation
   algorithm used by the Issuer to generate the digests over the salts
   and the claim values.

   The digest derivation algorithm identifier MUST be one of the
   following:

   *  a hash algorithm value from the "Hash Name String" column in the
      IANA "Named Information Hash Algorithm" registry
      [IANA.Hash.Algorithms]

   *  an HMAC algorithm value from the "Algorithmn Name" column in the
      IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry
      [IANA.JWS.Algorithms]

   *  a value defined in another specification and/or profile of this
      specification

   To promote interoperability, implementations MUST support the SHA-256
   hash algorithm.

   See Section 7 for requirements regarding entropy of the salt, minimum
   length of the salt, and choice of a digest derivation algorithm.

5.2.3.  Holder Public Key Claim

   If the Issuer wants to enable Holder Binding, it MAY include a public
   key associated with the Holder, or a reference thereto.

   It is out of the scope of this document to describe how the Holder
   key pair is established.  For example, the Holder MAY provide a key
   pair to the Issuer, the Issuer MAY create the key pair for the
   Holder, or Holder and Issuer MAY use pre-established key material.

   Note: Examples in this document use cnf Claim defined in [RFC7800] to
   include raw public key by value in SD-JWT.

5.3.  Example 1: SD-JWT

   This example uses the following object as the set of claims that the
   Issuer is issuing:

   {
     "sub": "john_doe_42",
     "given_name": "John",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "email": "johndoe@example.com",
     "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "123 Main St",
       "locality": "Anytown",
       "region": "Anystate",
       "country": "US"
     },
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01"
   }

   The following non-normative example shows the payload of an SD-JWT.
   The Issuer is using a flat structure in this case, i.e., all of the
   claims in the address claim can only be disclosed in full.

   {
     "_sd": [
       "NYCoSRKEYwXdpe5yduJXCxxhynEU8z-b4TyNiap77UY",
       "SY8n2BbkX9lrY3exHlSwPRFXoD09GF8a9CPO-G8j208",
       "TPsGNPYA46wmBxfv2znOJhfdoN5Y1GkezbpaGZCT1ac",

     ],
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1516239022,
     "exp": 1516247022,
     "sd_digest_derivation_alg": "sha-256",
     "cnf": {
       "jwk": {

         "e": "AQAB"
       }
     }
   }

   The SD-JWT is then signed by the Issuer to create a JWT like the
   following:

5.4.  Combined Format for Issuance

   Besides the SD-JWT itself, the Holder needs to learn the raw claim
   values that are contained in the SD-JWT, along with the precise input
   to the digest calculation and the salts.  To this end, the Issuer
   sends the Disclosure objects that were also used for the hash
   calculation, as described in Section 5.2.1.1, to the Holder.

   The data format for sending the SD-JWT and the Disclosures to the
   Holder is as follows:

   <SD-JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>

   This is called the Combined Format for Issuance.

   The Disclosures and SD-JWT are implicitly linked through the digest
   values of the Disclosures included in the SD-JWT.

5.4.1.  Example

   For Example 1, the Combined Format for Issuance looks as follows:

5.5.  Combined Format for Presentation

   For presentation to a Verifier, the Holder sends the SD-JWT and a
   selected subset of the Disclosures to the Verifier.

   The data format for sending the SD-JWT and the Disclosures to the
   Verifier is as follows (line break added for readability):

<SD-JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure M>~<optional Holder Binding JWT>

   This is called the Combined Format for Presentation.

   The Holder MAY send any subset of the Disclosures to the Verifier,
   i.e., none, multiple, or all Disclosures.

   A Holder MUST NOT send a Disclosure that was not included in the SD-
   JWT or send a Disclosure more than once.

5.5.1.  Enabling Holder Binding

   The Holder MAY add an optional JWT to prove Holder Binding to the
   Verifier.  The precise contents of the JWT are out of scope of this
   specification.  Usually, a nonce and aud claim are included to show
   that the proof is intended for the Verifier and to prevent replay
   attacks.  How the nonce or other claims are obtained by the Holder is
   out of scope of this specification.

   Example Holder Binding JWT payload:

   {
     "nonce": "XZOUco1u_gEPknxS78sWWg",
     "aud": "https://example.com/verifier",
     "iat": 1669193704
   }

   Which is then signed by the Holder to create a JWT like the
   following:

   xnNHfPbr5AhdYALCGg

   Whether to require Holder Binding is up to the Verifier's policy,
   based on the set of trust requirements such as trust frameworks it
   belongs to.

   Other ways of proving Holder Binding are possible, e.g., when the
   Combined Format for Presentation is itself embedded in a signed JWT.

   If no Holder Binding JWT is included, the Combined Format for
   Presentation ends with the ~ character after the last Disclosure.

5.5.2.  Example

   The following is a non-normative example of the contents of a
   Presentation for Example 1, disclosing the claims given_name,
   family_name, and address, as it would be sent from the Holder to the
   Verifier.  The Holder Binding JWT as shown before is included as the
   last element.

6.  Verification and Processing

6.1.  Processing by the Holder

   The Holder MUST perform the following (or equivalent) steps when
   receiving a Combined Format for Issuance:

   1.  Separate the SD-JWT and the Disclosures in the Combined Format
       for Issuance.

   2.  Hash all of the Disclosures separately.

   3.  Find the places in the SD-JWT where the digests of the
       Disclosures are included.  If any of the digests cannot be found
       in the SD-JWT, the Holder MUST reject the SD-JWT.

   4.  Decode Disclosures and obtain plaintext of the claim values.

   It is up to the Holder how to maintain the mapping between the
   Disclosures and the plaintext claim values to be able to display them
   to the End-User when needed.

   For presentation to a Verifier, the Holder MUST perform the following
   (or equivalent) steps:

   1.  Decide which Disclosures to release to the Verifier, obtaining
       proper End-User consent if necessary.

   2.  If Holder Binding is required, create a Holder Binding JWT.

   3.  Create the Combined Format for Presentation, including the
       selected Disclosures and, if applicable, the Holder Binding JWT.

   4.  Send the Presentation to the Verifier.

6.2.  Verification by the Verifier

   Upon receiving a Presentation, Verifiers MUST ensure that

   *  the SD-JWT is valid, i.e., it is signed by the Issuer and the
      signature is valid,

   *  all Disclosures are correct, i.e., their digests are referenced in
      the SD-JWT, and

   *  if Holder Binding is required, the Holder Binding JWT is signed by
      the Holder and valid.

   To this end, Verifiers MUST follow the following steps (or
   equivalent):

   1.  Determine if Holder Binding is to be checked according to the
       Verifier's policy for the use case at hand.  This decision MUST
       NOT be based on whether a Holder Binding JWT is provided by the
       Holder or not.  Refer to Section 7.7 for details.

   2.  Separate the Presentation into the SD-JWT, the Disclosures (if
       any), and the Holder Binding JWT (if provided).

   3.  Validate the SD-JWT:

       1.  Ensure that a signing algorithm was used that was deemed
           secure for the application.  Refer to [RFC8725], Sections 3.1
           and 3.2 for details.  The none algorithm MUST NOT be
           accepted.

       2.  Validate the signature over the SD-JWT.

       3.  Validate the Issuer of the SD-JWT and that the signing key
           belongs to this Issuer.

       4.  Check that the SD-JWT is valid using nbf, iat, and exp
           claims, if provided in the SD-JWT, and not selectively
           disclosed.

       5.  Check that the sd_digest_derivation_alg claim is present and
           its value is understood and the digest derivation algorithm
           is deemed secure.

   4.  Create a copy of the SD-JWT payload, if required for further
       processing.

   5.  Process the Disclosures.  For each Disclosure provided:

       1.  Calculate the hash digest over the base64url string as
           described in Section 5.2.1.2.

       2.  Find all _sd keys in the SD-JWT payload that contain a hash
           digest calculated in the previous step.  Note that there
           might be more than one _sd arrays in on SD-JWT.

           1.  If the digest cannot be found in the SD-JWT payload, the
               Verifier MUST reject the Presentation.

           2.  If there is more than one place where the digest is
               included, the Verifier MUST reject the Presentation.

           3.  If there is a key _sd that does not refer to an array,
               the Verifier MUST reject the Presentation.

           4.  Otherwise, insert, at the level of the _sd claim, the
               claim described by the Disclosure with the claim name and
               claim value provided in the Disclosure.

               1.  If the Disclosure is not a JSON-encoded array of
                   three elements, the Verifier MUST reject the
                   Presentation.

               2.  If the claim name already exists at the same level,
                   the Verifier MUST reject the Presentation.  Note that
                   this also means that if a Holder sends the same
                   Disclosure multiple times, the Verifier MUST reject
                   the Presentation.

               3.  If the claim value contains an object with an _sd key
                   (at the top level or nested deeper), the Verifier
                   MUST reject the Presentation.

       3.  Remove all _sd claims from the SD-JWT payload.

       4.  Remove the claim sd_digest_derivation_alg from the SD-JWT
           payload.

   6.  If Holder Binding is required:

       1.  If Holder Binding is provided by means not defined in this
           specification, verify the Holder Binding according to the
           method used.

       2.  Otherwise, verify the Holder Binding JWT as follows:

           1.  If Holder Binding JWT is not provided, the Verifier MUST
               reject the Presentation.

           2.  Determine the public key for the Holder from the SD-JWT.

           3.  Ensure that a signing algorithm was used that was deemed
               secure for the application.  Refer to [RFC8725], Sections
               3.1 and 3.2 for details.  The none algorithm MUST NOT be
               accepted.

           4.  Validate the signature over the Holder Binding JWT.

           5.  Check that the Holder Binding JWT is valid using nbf,
               iat, and exp claims, if provided in the Holder Binding
               JWT.

           6.  Determine that the Holder Binding JWT is bound to the
               current transaction and was created for this Verifier
               (replay protection).  This is usually achieved by a nonce
               and aud field within the Holder Binding JWT.

   If any step fails, the Presentation is not valid and processing MUST
   be aborted.

   Otherwise, the processed SD-JWT payload can be passed to the
   application to be used for the intended purpose.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Mandatory digest computation of the revealed claim values by the
      Verifier

   ToDo: add text explaining mechanisms that should be adopted to ensure
   that Verifiers validate the claim values received in HS-Disclosures
   JWT by calculating the digests of those values and comparing them
   with the digests in the SD-JWT: - create a test suite that forces
   digest computation by the Verifiers, and includes negative test cases
   in test vectors - use only implementations/libraries that are
   compliant to the test suite - etc.

7.2.  Mandatory signing of the SD-JWT

   The SD-JWT MUST be signed by the Issuer to protect integrity of the
   issued claims.  An attacker can modify or add claims if an SD-JWT is
   not signed (e.g., change the "email" attribute to take over the
   victim's account or add an attribute indicating a fake academic
   qualification).

   The Verifier MUST always check the SD-JWT signature to ensure that
   the SD-JWT has not been tampered with since its issuance.  If the
   signature on the SD-JWT cannot be verified, the SD-JWT MUST be
   rejected.

7.3.  Manipulation of Disclosures

   Holders can manipulate the Disclosures by changing the values of the
   claims before sending them to the Issuer.  The Issuer MUST check the
   Disclosures to ensure that the values of the claims are correct,
   i.e., the hash digests of the Disclosures are actually present in the
   signed SD-JWT.

   A naive Issuer that extracts all claim values from the Disclosures
   (without checking the hashes) and inserts them into the SD-JWT
   payload is vulnerable to this attack.  However, in a structured SD-
   JWT, without comparing the digests of the Disclosures, such an
   implementation could not determine the correct place in a nested
   object where a claim needs to be inserted.  Therefore, the naive
   implementation would not only be insecure, but also incorrect.

   The steps described in Section 6.2 ensure that the Verifier checks
   the Disclosures correctly.

7.4.  Entropy of the salt

   The security model relies on the fact that the salt is not learned or
   guessed by the attacker.  It is vitally important to adhere to this
   principle.  As such, the salt MUST be created in such a manner that
   it is cryptographically random, long enough and has high entropy that
   it is not practical for the attacker to guess.  A new salt MUST be
   chosen for each claim.

7.5.  Minimum length of the salt

   The RECOMMENDED minimum length of the randomly-generated portion of
   the salt is 128 bits.

   Note that minimum 128 bits would be necessary when SHA-256, HMAC-
   SHA256, or a function of similar strength is used, but a smaller salt
   size might achieve similar level of security if a stronger iterative
   derivation function is used.

   The Issuer MUST ensure that a new salt value is chosen for each
   claim, including when the same claim name occurs at different places
   in the structure of the SD-JWT.  This can be seen in Example 3 in the
   Appendix, where multiple claims with the name type appear, but each
   of them has a different salt.

7.6.  Choice of a digest derivation algorithm

   For the security of this scheme, the digest derivation algorithm is
   required to be preimage and collision resistant, i.e., it is
   infeasible to calculate the salt and claim value that result in a
   particular digest, and it is infeasible to find a different salt and
   claim value pair that result in a matching digest, respectively.

   Furthermore the hash algorithms MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-160, and SHA-1
   revealed fundamental weaknesses and they MUST NOT be used.

7.7.  Holder Binding

   Verifiers MUST decide whether Holder Binding is required for a
   particular use case or not before verifying a credential.  This
   decision can be informed by various factors including, but not
   limited to the following: business requirements, the use case, the
   type of binding between a Holder and its credential that is required
   for a use case, the sensitivity of the use case, the expected
   properties of a credential, the type and contents of other
   credentials expected to be presented at the same time, etc.

   This can be showcased based on two scenarios for a mobile driver's
   license use case for SD-JWT:

   *Scenario A:* For the verification of the driver's license when
   stopped by a police officer for exceeding a speed limit, Holder
   Binding may be necessary to ensure that the person driving the car
   and presenting the license is the actual Holder of the license.  The
   Verifier (e.g., the software used by the police officer) will ensure
   that a Holder Binding JWT is present and signed with the Holder's
   private key.

   *Scenario B:* A rental car agency may want to ensure, for insurance
   purposes, that all drivers named on the rental contract own a
   government-issued driver's license.  The signer of the rental
   contract can present the mobile driver's license of all named
   drivers.  In this case, the rental car agency does not need to check
   Holder Binding as the goal is not to verify the identity of the
   person presenting the license, but to verify that a license exists
   and is valid.

   It is important that a Verifier does not make its security policy
   decisions based on data that can be influenced by an attacker or that
   can be misinterpreted.  For this reason, when deciding whether Holder
   binding is required or not, Verifiers MUST NOT take into account

   *  whether an Holder Binding JWT is present or not, as an attacker
      can remove the Holder Binding JWT from any Presentation and
      present it to the Verifier, or

   *  whether a key reference is present in the SD-JWT or not, as the
      Issuer might have added the key to the SD-JWT in a format/claim
      that is not recognized by the Verifier.

   If a Verifier has decided that Holder Binding is required for a
   particular use case and the Holder Binding is not present, does not
   fulfill the requirements (e.g., on the signing algorithm), or no
   recognized key reference is present in the SD-JWT, the Verifier will
   reject the presentation, as described in Section 6.2.

7.8.  Blinding Claim Names

   SD-JWT ensures that names of claims that are selectively disclosable
   are always blinded.  This prevents an attacker from learning the
   names of the disclosable claims.  However, the names of the claims
   that are not disclosable are not blinded.  This includes the keys of
   objects that themselves are not blinded, but contain disclosable
   claims.  This limitation needs to be taken into account by Issuers
   when creating the structure of the SD-JWT.

8.  Privacy Considerations

8.1.  Decoy Digests

   The use of decoy digests is RECOMMENDED when the number of claims (or
   the existence of particular claims) can be a side-channel disclosing
   information about otherwise undisclosed claims.  In particular, if a
   claim in an SD-JWT is present only if a certain condition is met
   (e.g., a membership number is only contained if the End-User is a
   member of a group), the Issuer SHOULD add decoy digests when the
   condition is not met.

   Decoy digests increase the size of the SD-JWT.  The number of decoy
   digests (or whether to use them at all) is a trade-off between the
   size of the SD-JWT and the privacy of the End-User's data.

8.2.  Unlinkability

   Colluding Issuer/Verifier or Verifier/Verifier pairs could link
   issuance/presentation or two presentation sessions to the same user
   on the basis of unique values encoded in the SD-JWT (Issuer
   signature, salts, digests, etc.).

   To prevent these types of linkability, various methods, including but
   not limited to the following ones can be used:

   *  Use advanced cryptographic schemes, outside the scope of this
      specification.

   *  Issue a batch of SD-JWTs to the Holder to enable the Holder to use
      a unique SD-JWT per Verifier.  This only helps with Verifier/
      Verifier unlinkability.

Appendix A.  Additional Examples

   All of the following examples are non-normative.

A.1.  Example 2a: Handling Structured Claims

   This example uses the following object as the set of claims that the
   Issuer is issuing:

   {
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "given_name": "太郎",
     "family_name": "山田",
     "email": "\"unusual email address\"@nihon.com",
     "phone_number": "123456",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "東京都港区芝公園４丁目２−８",
       "locality": "東京都",
       "region": "港区",
       "country": "JP"
     },
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01"
   }

   Note that in contrast to Example 1, here the Issuer decided to create
   a structured object for the address claim, allowing for separate
   disclosure of the individual members of the claim.

   {
     "_sd": [
       "D12FaaMXCOWOF4xAUG1s_TnqhZ903-BkDewPkhjYIHY",

A.2.  Example 2b: Adding Decoys

   This example is based on the same set of user data as Example 2a, but
   here, the Issuer decided to add decoy digests to the SD-JWT.

   The SD-JWT payload is as follows:

   {
     "_sd": [
       "0--cgzkgM91JyfIA_iZW_bk0NTNjk--MkMuaA_tuIxY",
       "G0ovA7TMC4JdDDt54P5EBdDcQSatb77H5zufZeHyxIc",
       "HfO8OBD5TiO9NkVMYuHf2y1tRPRzsO4vD4kUO3k--Rc",
       "I5MIO3LppLAEoO4b91ufH2O0878hspuJEBJSmA_S5Fs",
       "IiApkhig8WiIpOb37u1a-oLhYuyFkxOEBXNC7DSMvL4",
       "Ogxyqqp6jFRvfmDMzEdychfk6EKoFm8QWMNcBd2AqAk",

       "iRS2dVAl_bpXlyvwDSShEJ22v28ZFfXoTd_vp5QNCzM",
       "lKTMGzf0d79BaiwuEpMYC26hABeIUtcI7WHl7zgeXCU",
       "sjEgA8-j44T-2XXJZshzDOnLSaLQF8Iyhb4a7BcZrRY"
     ],
     "address": {
       "_sd": [
         "0JOH_ZsjHpzU6RBYBTzSOWRzT6BPNYBRo3eaa0mb6Qc",
         "O9gL7Tof4PtmSzuG6C2758uvpqJlJisMtJXAD8DDSBU",
         "OS38kU3-IrxPpbs1Owdmr1BsXw7o6v6Wvo0-P8Gj4cE",
         "bTvbv9_F4EGMTwOZ9BKguES9p2WCGC2xXyZ1tiPWuNI",
         "l8JvgLKuPV-IpKRNHg15DVJ-f2yf_DNXLrIW5Ujmjws",
         "srYNH_kZ-h7VkI1OAp8ndz9151q4qQpkFiUeH8T8_hs"
       ]
     },
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "iat": 1516239022,
     "exp": 1516247022,
     "sd_digest_derivation_alg": "sha-256"
   }

   Since the Disclosures or Presentation are not affected by the decoy
   digests (other than a slightly larger SD-JWT), they are omitted here.

A.3.  Example 3 - Complex Structured SD-JWT

   In this example, an SD-JWT with a complex object is demonstrated.
   Here, the data structures defined in OIDC4IDA [OIDC.IDA] are used.

   The Issuer is using the following user data:

   The Issuer in this example sends the two claims birthdate and
   place_of_birth in the claims element in plain text.  The following
   shows the resulting SD-JWT payload:

   With the following Disclosures:

   The Verifier would receive the Issuer-signed SD-JWT together with a
   selection of the Disclosures.  The Presentation in this example would
   look as follows:

   After the verification of the data, the Verifier will pass the
   following result on to the application for further processing:

A.4.  Example 4 - W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model (work in
      progress)

   This example illustrates how the artifacts defined in this
   specification can be represented using W3C Verifiable Credentials
   Data Model as defined in [VC_DATA].

   SD-JWT is equivalent to an Issuer-signed W3C Verifiable Credential
   (W3C VC).  Disclosures are sent alongside a VC.

   A Presentation with a Holder Binding JWT is equivalent to a Holder-
   signed W3C Verifiable Presentation (W3C VP).

   Holder Binding is applied and the Holder Binding JWT is signed using
   a raw public key passed in a cnf Claim in a W3C VC (SD-JWT).

   Below is a non-normative example of an SD-JWT represented as a
   verifiable credential encoded as JSON and signed as JWS compliant to
   [VC_DATA].

   The following data will be used in this example:

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com",
     "jti": "http://example.com/credentials/3732",
     "nbf": 1541493724,

       }
     },
     "type": "IdentityCredential",
     "credentialSubject": {
       "given_name": "John",
       "family_name": "Doe",

       "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
       "address": {
         "street_address": "123 Main St",
         "locality": "Anytown",

       },
       "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
       "is_over_18": true,
       "is_over_21": true,
       "is_over_65": true
     }
   }

   The encoded SD-JWT looks as follows:

Appendix B.  Document History

   [[ To be removed from the final specification ]]

   -03

   *  Disclosures are now delivered not as a JWT but as separate
      base64url-encoded JSON objects.

   *  In the SD-JWT, hash digests are collected under a _sd claim per
      level.

   *  Terms "II-Disclosures" and "HS-Disclosures" are replaced with
      "Disclosures".

   *  Holder Binding is now separate from delivering the Disclosures and
      implemented, if required, with a separate JWT.

   *  Examples updated and modified to properly explain the specifics of
      the new SD-JWT format.

   *  Examples are now pulled in from the examples directory, not
      inlined.

   *  Updated and automated the W3C VC example.

   *  Added examples with multibyte characters to show that the
      specification and demo code work well with UTF-8.

   -02

   *  reformatted

   -01

   *  introduced blinded claim names

   *  explained why JSON-encoding of values is needed

   *  explained merging algorithm ("processing model")

   *  generalized hash alg to digest derivation alg which also enables
      HMAC to calculate digests

   *  sd_hash_alg renamed to sd_digest_derivation_alg

   *  Salt/Value Container (SVC) renamed to Issuer-Issued Disclosures
      (II-Disclosures)

   *  SD-JWT-Release (SD-JWT-R) renamed to Holder-Selected Disclosures
      (HS-Disclosures)

   *  sd_disclosure in II-Disclosures renamed to sd_ii_disclosures

   *  sd_disclosure in HS-Disclosures renamed to sd_hs_disclosures

   *  clarified relationship between sd_hs_disclosure and SD-JWT

   *  clarified combined formats for issuance and presentation

   *  clarified security requirements for blinded claim names

   *  improved description of Holder Binding security considerations -
      especially around the usage of "alg=none".

   *  updated examples

   *  text clarifications

   *  fixed cnf structure in examples

   *  added feature summary

   -00

   *  Upload as draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-00

   [[ pre Working Group Adoption: ]]

   -02

   *  Added acknowledgements

   *  Improved Security Considerations

   *  Stressed entropy requirements for salts

   *  Python reference implementation clean-up and refactoring

   *  hash_alg renamed to sd_hash_alg

   -01

   *  Editorial fixes

   *  Added hash_alg claim

   *  Renamed _sd to sd_digests and sd_release

   *  Added descriptions on Holder Binding - more work to do

   *  Clarify that signing the SD-JWT is mandatory

   -00

   *  Renamed to SD-JWT (focus on JWT instead of JWS since signature is
      optional)

   *  Make Holder Binding optional

   *  Rename proof to release, since when there is no signature, the
      term "proof" can be misleading

   *  Improved the structure of the description

   *  Described verification steps

   *  All examples generated from python demo implementation

   *  Examples for structured objects
