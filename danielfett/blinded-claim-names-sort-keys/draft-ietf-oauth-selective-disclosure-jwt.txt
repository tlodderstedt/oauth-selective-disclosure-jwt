1.  Introduction

   The JSON-based representation of claims in a signed JSON Web Token
   (JWT) [RFC7519] is secured against modification using JSON Web
   Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] digital signatures.  A consumer of a signed
   JWT that has checked the signature can safely assume that the
   contents of the token have not been modified.  However, anyone
   receiving an unencrypted JWT can read all of the claims and likewise,
   anyone with the decryption key receiving an encrypted JWT can also
   read all of the claims.

   This document describes a format for signed JWTs that supports
   selective disclosure (SD-JWT), enabling sharing only a subset of the
   claims included in the original signed JWT instead of releasing all
   the claims to every verifier.  During issuance, an SD-JWT is sent
   from the issuer to the holder alongside an II-Disclosures object, a
   JSON object that contains the mapping between raw claim values
   contained in the SD-JWT and the salts for each claim value.

   This document also defines a format for HS-Disclosures JWT, which
   convey a subset of the claim values of an SD-JWT to the verifier.
   For presentation, the holder creates a HS-Disclosures JWT and sends
   it together with the SD-JWT to the verifier.  To verify claim values
   received in HS-Disclosures JWT, the verifier uses the salts values in
   the HS-Disclosures JWT to compute the digests of the claim values and
   compare them to the ones in the SD-JWT.

   One of the common use cases of a signed JWT is representing a user's
   identity created by an issuer.  As long as the signed JWT is one-time
   use, it typically only contains those claims the user has consented
   to disclose to a specific verifier.  However, when a signed JWT is
   intended to be multi-use, it needs to contain the superset of all
   claims the user might want to disclose to verifiers at some point.
   The ability to selectively disclose a subset of these claims
   depending on the verifier becomes crucial to ensure minimum
   disclosure and prevent verifiers from obtaining claims irrelevant for
   the transaction at hand.

   One example of such a multi-use JWT is a verifiable credential, a
   tamper-evident credential with a cryptographically verifiable
   authorship that contains claims about a subject.  SD-JWTs defined in
   this document enable such selective disclosure of claims.

   While JWTs for claims describing natural persons are a common use
   case, the mechanisms defined in this document can be used for many
   other use cases as well.

   This document also describes holder binding, or the concept of
   binding SD-JWT to key material controlled by the subject of SD-JWT.
   Holder binding is optional to implement.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *base64url* denotes the URL-safe base64 encoding without padding
   defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515].

2.  Terms and Definitions

   Selectively Disclosable JWT (SD-JWT)  A JWT [RFC7515] created by the
      issuer, which is signed as a JWS [RFC7515], that supports
      selective disclosure as defined in this document.

   Disclosure  A combination of the cleartext claim value, the cleartext
      claim name, a salt and optionally blinded claim name value that is
      used to calculate a digest for a certain claim.

   Issuer-Issued Disclosures Object (II-Disclosures Object)  A JSON
      object created by the issuer that contains mapping between raw
      claim values contained in the SD-JWT and the salts for each claim
      value.

   Holder-Selected Disclosures JWT (HS-Disclosures JWT)  A JWT created
      by the Holder that contains the Disclosures from an Issuer-Issued
      Disclosures Object that the Holder is disclosing to the Verifier.
      In addition to the Disclosures, it can contain other properties
      and may be signed by the Holder.

   claim values of an SD-JWT in a verifiable way.

   Holder binding  Ability of the holder to prove legitimate possession
      of SD-JWT by proving control over the same private key during the
      issuance and presentation.  SD-JWT signed by the issuer contains a
      public key or a reference to a public key that matches to the
      private key controlled by the holder.

   Claim name blinding  Feature that enables to blind not only claim
      values, but also claim names of the claims that are included in
      SD-JWT but are not disclosed to the verifier in the HS-Disclosures
      JWT.

   Issuer  An entity that creates SD-JWTs.

   Holder  An entity that received SD-JWTs from the issuer and has
      control over them.

   Verifier  An entity that requests, checks and extracts the claims
      from HS-Disclosures JWT.

   Selective disclosure  Process of a Holder disclosing to a Verifier a
      subset of claims contained in a claim set issued by an Issuer.

   Note: discuss if we want to include Client, Authorization Server for
   the purpose of ensuring continuity and separating the entity from the
   actor.

4.  Concepts

   In the following, the contents of SD-JWTs and HS-Disclosures JWTs are
   described at a conceptual level, abstracting from the data formats
   described afterwards.

4.1.  Creating an SD-JWT

   An SD-JWT, at its core, is a digitally signed document containing
   digests over the claim values with random salts and other metadata.
   It MUST be digitally signed using the issuer's private key.

   SD-JWT-DOC = (METADATA, SD-CLAIMS)
   SD-JWT = SD-JWT-DOC | SIG(SD-JWT-DOC, ISSUER-PRIV-KEY)

   SD-CLAIMS is an object with claim names (CLAIM-NAME) mapped to the
   digests over the claim values (CLAIM-VALUE) with random salts (SALT).
   Digests are calculated using a digest derivation function such as a
   hash function, HMAC, or other (DIGEST-DERIVATION()):

   SD-CLAIMS = (
       CLAIM-NAME: DIGEST-DERIVATION(SALT, CLAIM-VALUE)
   )*

   When an HMAC or another type of derivation function is used for
   digest calculation, a secret cryptographic key or other cryptographic
   secret is used instead of a salt value.  However, the term "salt" is
   used throughout this document for brevity.

   SD-CLAIMS can also be nested deeper to capture more complex objects,
   as will be shown later.

   SD-JWT is sent from the issuer to the holder, together with the
   mapping of the plain-text claim values, the salt values, and
   potentially some other information.

4.2.  Creating an Holder-Selected Disclosures JWT

   To disclose to a verifier a subset of the SD-JWT claim values, a
   holder creates a JWT such as the following:

   HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES-DOC = (METADATA, SD-DISCLOSURES)
   HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES-JWT = HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES-DOC

   SD-DISCLOSURES follows the structure of SD-CLAIMS and can be a simple
   object with claim names mapped to values and salts:

   SD-DISCLOSURES = (
       CLAIM-NAME: (DISCLOSED-SALT, DISCLOSED-VALUE)
   )

   Just as SD-CLAIMS, SD-DISCLOSURES can be more complex as well.

   HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES-JWT is sent together with SD-JWT from the
   holder to the verifier.

4.3.  Optional Holder Binding

   Some use-cases may require holder binding.

   If holder binding is desired, SD-JWT must contain information about
   key material controlled by the holder:

   SD-JWT-DOC = (METADATA, HOLDER-PUBLIC-KEY, SD-CLAIMS)

   Note: How the public key is included in SD-JWT is out of scope of
   this document.  It can be passed by value or by reference.

   With holder binding, the HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES-JWT is signed by
   the holder using its private key.  It therefore looks as follows:

HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES = HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES-DOC | SIG(HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES-DOC, HOLDER-PRIV-KEY)

4.3.1.  Optional Claim Name Blinding

   If claim name blinding is used, SD-CLAIMS is created as follows:

SD-CLAIMS = (
    CLAIM-NAME-PLACEHOLDER: DIGEST-DERIVATION(SALT, CLAIM-VALUE, CLAIM-NAME)
)*

   CLAIM-NAME-PLACEHOLDER is a placeholder used instead of the original
   claim name, chosen such that it does not leak information about the
   claim name (e.g., randomly).

   The contents of SD-DISCLOSURES are modified as follows:

SD-DISCLOSURES = (
    CLAIM-NAME-PLACEHOLDER: (DISCLOSED-SALT, DISCLOSED-VALUE, DISCLOSED-CLAIM-NAME)
)

   Note that blinded and unblinded claim names can be mixed in SD-CLAIMS
   and accordingly in SD-DISCLOSURES.

4.4.  Verifying an Holder-Selected Disclosures JWT

   A verifier checks that

   *  for each claim in HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES, the digest over the
      disclosed values matches the digest under the given claim name in
      SD-JWT,

   *  if holder binding is used, the HOLDER-SELECTED-DISCLOSURES was
      signed by the private key belonging to HOLDER-PUBLIC-KEY.

   The detailed algorithm is described below.

5.  Data Formats

   This section defines data formats for SD-JWT (containing digests of
   the salted claim values), Issuer-Issued Disclosures (containing the
   mapping of the plain-text claim values and the salt values), and HS-
   Disclosures (containing a subset of the same mapping).

5.1.  The Challenge of Canonicalization

   When receiving an SD-JWT with an associated Release, a verifier must
   be able to re-compute digests of the disclosed claim value and, given
   the same input values, obtain the same digest values as signed by the
   issuer.

   Usually, JSON-based formats transport claim values as simple
   properties of a JSON object such as this:

   ...
     "family_name": "Möbius",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
       "locality": "Schulpforta"
     }
   ...

   However, a problem arises when computation over the data need to be
   performed and verified, like signing or computing digests.  Common
   signature schemes require the same byte string as input to the
   signature verification as was used for creating the signature.  In
   the digest derivation approach outlined above, the same problem
   exists: for the issuer and the verifier to arrive at the same digest,
   the same byte string must be hashed.

   JSON, however, does not prescribe a unique encoding for data, but
   allows for variations in the encoded string.  The data above, for
   example, can be encoded as

   ...
   "family_name": "M\u00f6bius",
   "address": {
     "street_address": "Schulstr. 12",
     "locality": "Schulpforta"
   }
   ...

   or as

  ...
  "family_name": "Möbius",
  "address": {"locality":"Schulpforta", "street_address":"Schulstr. 12"}
  ...

   The two representations "M\u00f6bius" and "M&#246;bius" are very
   different on the byte-level, but yield equivalent objects.  Same for
   the representations of address, varying in white space and order of
   elements in the object.

   The variations in white space, ordering of object properties, and
   encoding of Unicode characters are all allowed by the JSON
   specification.  Other variations, e.g., concerning floating-point
   numbers, are described in [RFC8785].  Variations can be introduced
   whenever JSON data is serialized or deserialized and unless dealt
   with, will lead to different digests and the inability to verify
   signatures.

   There are generally two approaches to deal with this problem:

   1.  Canonicalization: The data is transferred in JSON format,
       potentially introducing variations in its representation, but is
       transformed into a canonical form before computing a digest.
       Both the issuer and the verifier must use the same
       canonicalization algorithm to arrive at the same byte string for
       computing a digest.

   2.  Source string encoding: Instead of transferring data in JSON
       format that may introduce variations, the serialized data that is
       used as the digest input is transferred from the issuer to the
       verifier.  This means that the verifier can easily check the
       digest over the byte string before deserializing the data.

   Mixed approaches are conceivable, i.e., transferring both the
   original JSON data plus a string suitable for computing a digest, but
   such approaches can easily lead to undetected inconsistencies
   resulting in time-of-check-time-of-use type security vulnerabilities.

   In this specification, the source string encoding approach is used,
   as it allows for simple and reliable interoperability without the
   requirement for a canonicalization library.  To encode the source
   string, JSON itself is used.  This approach means that SD-JWTs can be
   implemented purely based on widely available JSON encoding and
   decoding libraries without the need for a custom data format for
   encoding data.

   To produce a source string to compute a digest, the data is put into
   a JSON object together with the salt value, like so (non-normative
   example, see Section 5.2.1 for details):

   {"s": "6qMQvRL5haj", "v": "Möbius"}

   Or, for the address example above:

   {"s": "al1N3Zom221", "v":
     {"locality": "Schulpforta", "street_address": "Schulstr. 12"}}

   (Line break and indentation of the second line for presentation
   only!)

   This object is then JSON-encoded and used as the source string.  The
   JSON-encoded value is transferred in the HS-Disclosures instead of
   the original JSON data:

   "family_name": "{\"s\": \"6qMQvRL5haj\", \"v\": \"M\\u00f6bius\"}"

   Or, for the address example:

   "address": "{\"s\": \"al1N3Zom221\", \"v\":
     {\"locality\": \"Schulpforta\",
     \"street_address\": \"Schulstr. 12\"}}"

   (Line break and indentation of the second and third line for
   presentation only!)

   A verifier can then easily check the digest over the source string
   before extracting the original JSON data.  Variations in the encoding
   of the source string are implicitly tolerated by the verifier, as the
   digest is computed over a predefined byte string and not over a JSON
   object.

   Since the encoding is based on JSON, all value types that are allowed
   in JSON are also allowed in the v property in the source string.
   This includes numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.

   It is important to note that the HS-Disclosures containing the source
   string is neither intended nor suitable for direct consumption by an
   application that needs to access the disclosed claim values.  The SD-
   JWT-Release are only intended to be used by a verifier to check the
   digests over the source strings and to extract the original JSON
   data.  The original JSON data is then used by the application.  See
   Section 6.3 for details.

5.2.  Format of an SD-JWT

   An SD-JWT is a JWT that MUST be signed using the issuer's private
   key.  The payload of an SD-JWT MUST contain the sd_digests and
   sd_digest_derivation_alg claims described in the following, and MAY
   contain a holder's public key or a reference thereto, as well as
   further claims such as iss, iat, etc. as defined or required by the
   application using SD-JWTs.

5.2.1.  sd_digests Claim (Digests of Selectively Disclosable Claims)

   The property sd_digests MUST be used by the issuer to include digests
   of the salted claim values for any claim that is intended to be
   selectively disclosable.

   The issuer MUST choose a cryptographically random salt value for each
   claim value.  The salt value MUST then be encoded as a string.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to base64url-encode the salt value.

   The issuer MUST generate the digests over a JSON literal according to
   [RFC8259] that is formed by JSON-encoding an object with the
   following contents:

   *  REQUIRED with the key s: the salt value,

   *  REQUIRED with the key v: the claim value (either a string or a
      more complex object, e.g., for the [OIDC] address claim),

   *  OPTIONAL, with the key n: the claim name (if claim name blinding
      is to be used for this claim).

   The following is an example for a JSON literal without claim name
   blinding:

   {"s": "6qMQvRL5haj", "v": "Peter"}

   The following is an example for a JSON literal with claim name
   blinding:

   {"s": "6qMQvRL5haj", "v": "Peter", "n": "given_name"}

   The sd_digests claim contains an object where claim names are mapped
   to the respective digests.  If a claim name is to be blinded, the
   digests MUST contain the n key as described above and the claim name
   in sd_digests MUST be replaced by a placeholder value that does not
   leak information about the claim's original name.  The same
   placeholder value is to be used in the II-Disclosures and HS-
   Disclosures described below.

5.2.1.1.  Flat and Structured sd_digests objects

   The sd_digests object can be a 'flat' object, directly containing all
   claim names and digests without any deeper structure.  The sd_digests
   object can also be a 'structured' object, where some claims and their
   respective digests are contained in places deeper in the structure.
   It is at the issuer's discretion whether to use a 'flat' or
   'structured' sd_digests SD-JWT object, and how to structure it such
   that it is suitable for the use case.

   Example 1 below is a non-normative example of an SD-JWT using a
   'flat' sd_digests object and Example 2a in the appendix shows a non-
   normative example of an SD-JWT using a 'structured' sd_digests
   object.  The difference between the examples is how the address claim
   is disclosed.

   Appendix 2 shows a more complex example using claims from eKYC (todo:
   reference).

5.2.2.  Digest Derivation Function Claim

   The claim sd_digest_derivation_alg indicates the digest derivation
   algorithm used by the Issuer to generate the digests over the salts
   and the claim values.

   The digest derivation algorithm identifier MUST be one of the
   following: - a hash algorithm value from the "Hash Name String"
   column in the IANA "Named Information Hash Algorithm" registry
   [IANA.Hash.Algorithms] - an HMAC algorithm value from the "Algorithmn
   Name" column in the IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption
   Algorithms" registry [IANA.JWS.Algorithms] - a value defined in
   another specification and/or profile of this specification

   To promote interoperability, implementations MUST support the SHA-256
   hash algorithm.

   See Section 7 for requirements regarding entropy of the salt, minimum
   length of the salt, and choice of a digest derivation algorithm.

5.2.3.  Holder Public Key Claim

   If the issuer wants to enable holder binding, it MAY include a public
   key associated with the holder, or a reference thereto.

   It is out of the scope of this document to describe how the holder
   key pair is established.  For example, the holder MAY provide a key
   pair to the issuer, the issuer MAY create the key pair for the
   holder, or holder and issuer MAY use pre-established key material.

   Note: Examples in this document use cnf Claim defined in [RFC7800] to
   include raw public key by value in SD-JWT.

5.3.  Example 1: SD-JWT

   This example and Example 2a in the appendix use the following object

   Important: Throughout the examples in this document, line breaks had
   to be added to JSON strings and base64-encoded strings (as shown in
   the next example) to adhere to the 72 character limit for lines in
   RFCs and for readability.  JSON does not allow line breaks in
   strings.

   The SD-JWT is then signed by the issuer to create a document like the
   following:

5.4.  Format of an Issuer-Issued Disclosures Object

   Besides the SD-JWT itself, the holder needs to learn the raw claim
   values that are contained in the SD-JWT, along with the precise input
   to the digest calculation, and the salts.  There MAY be other
   information the issuer needs to communicate to the holder, such as a
   private key if the issuer selected the holder key pair.

   An Issuer-Issued Disclosures Object (II-Disclosures Object) is a JSON
   object containing at least the top-level property sd_ii_disclosures.
   Its structure mirrors the one of sd_digests in the SD-JWT, but the
   values are the inputs to the digest calculations the issuer used, as
   strings.

   The II-Disclosures Object MAY contain further properties, for
   example, to transport the holder private key.

5.5.  Example: Issuer-Issued Disclosures Object for the Flat SD-JWT in
      Example 1

   The II-Disclosures Object for Example 1 is as follows:

   {
     "sd_ii_disclosures": {
       "sub": "{\"s\": \"YZSmzeu7lFHUbZ8Z1QqH9Q\", \"v\":
         \"6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c\"}",
       "given_name": "{\"s\": \"kHHp91-tAZt8m9E4Jl4XbQ\", \"v\":
         \"John\"}",
       "family_name": "{\"s\": \"PjIqpGWl4eB4QroDhqQw0w\", \"v\":
         \"Doe\"}",
       "email": "{\"s\": \"QRamZSB5Ky0MeJyz4EAleA\", \"v\":
         \"johndoe@example.com\"}",
       "phone_number": "{\"s\": \"xniP4JZtNWIH-Lk_Dt-o-A\", \"v\":
         \"+1-202-555-0101\"}",
       "address": "{\"s\": \"KtfsxxTm2mw0YLUcKZU8tA\", \"v\":
         {\"street_address\": \"123 Main St\", \"locality\":
         \"Anytown\", \"region\": \"Anystate\", \"country\": \"US\"}}",
       "birthdate": "{\"s\": \"Ozd4wBLBwqGzJhJvTmQwdQ\", \"v\":
         \"1940-01-01\"}"
     }
   }

   Important: As described above, digests are calculated over the JSON
   literal formed by serializing an object containing the salt, the
   claim value, and optionally the claim name.  This ensures that issuer
   and verifier use the same input to their digest derivation algorithms
   and avoids issues with canonicalization of JSON values that would
   lead to different digests.  The II-Disclosures Object therefore maps
   claim names to JSON-encoded arrays.

5.6.  Sending SD-JWT and Issuer-Issued Disclosures Object during
      Issuance

   For transporting the II-Disclosures Object together with the SD-JWT
   from the issuer to the holder, the II-Disclosures Object is
   base64url-encoded and appended to the SD-JWT using a period character
   . as the separator.

   The II-Disclosures Object and SD-JWT are implicitly linked through
   the digest values of the claims in the II-Disclosures Object that is
   included in the SD-JWT.  To ensure that the correct II-Disclosures
   Object and SD-JWT pairings are being used, the holder SHOULD verify
   the binding between II-Disclosures Object and SD-JWT as defined in
   the Verification Section of this document.

   For Example 1, the combined format looks as follows:

5.7.  Format of an Holder-Selected Disclosures JWT

   HS-Disclosures JWT contains claim values and the salts of the claims
   that the holder has consented to disclose to the Verifier.  This
   enables the Verifier to verify the claims received from the holder by
   computing the digests of the claim values and the salts revealed in
   the HS-Disclosures JWT using the digest derivation algorithm
   specified in SD-JWT and comparing them to the digests included in SD-
   JWT.

   For each claim, an array of the salt and the claim value is contained
   in the sd_hs_disclosures object.  The structure of an
   sd_hs_disclosures object in the HS-Disclosures JWT is the same as the
   structure of an sd_ii_disclosures object in II-Disclosures Object.

   The HS-Disclosures JWT MAY contain further claims, for example, to
   ensure a binding to a concrete transaction (in the example the nonce
   and aud claims).

   When the holder sends the HS-Disclosures JWT to the Verifier, the HS-
   Disclosures JWT MUST be a JWS represented as the JWS Compact
   Serialization as described in Section 7.1 of [RFC7515].

   If holder binding is desired, the HS-Disclosures JWT is signed by the
   holder.  If no holder binding is to be used, the none algorithm is
   used, i.e., the document is not signed.  TODO: Change to plain base64
   to avoid alg=none issues

5.8.  Example: Holder-Selected Disclosures JWT for Example 1

   The following is a non-normative example of the contents of a HS-
   Disclosures JWT for Example 1:

   {
     "nonce": "XZOUco1u_gEPknxS78sWWg",
     "aud": "https://example.com/verifier",
     "sd_hs_disclosures": {
       "given_name": "{\"s\": \"kHHp91-tAZt8m9E4Jl4XbQ\", \"v\":
         \"John\"}",
       "family_name": "{\"s\": \"PjIqpGWl4eB4QroDhqQw0w\", \"v\":
         \"Doe\"}",
       "address": "{\"s\": \"KtfsxxTm2mw0YLUcKZU8tA\", \"v\":
         {\"street_address\": \"123 Main St\", \"locality\":
         \"Anytown\", \"region\": \"Anystate\", \"country\": \"US\"}}"
     }
   }

   For each claim, a JSON literal that decodes to an object with the and
   the claim value (plus optionally the claim name) is contained in the
   sd_hs_disclosures object.

   Again, the HS-Disclosures JWT follows the same structure as the
   sd_digests in the SD-JWT.

   Below is a non-normative example of a representation of the HS-
   Disclosures JWT using JWS Compact Serialization:

6.  Verification and Processing

6.1.  Verification by the Holder when Receiving SD-JWT and Issuer-Issued
      Disclosures Object

   The holder SHOULD verify the binding between SD-JWT and II-
   Disclosures Object by performing the following steps: 1.  Check that
   all the claims in the II-Disclosures Object are present in the SD-JWT
   and that there are no claims in the SD-JWT that are not in the II-
   Disclosures Object 2.  Check that the digests of the claims in the
   II-Disclosures Object match those in the SD-JWT

6.2.  Verification by the Verifier when Receiving SD-JWT and Holder-
      Selected Disclosures JWT

   Verifiers MUST follow [RFC8725] for checking the SD-JWT and, if
   signed, the HS-Disclosures JWT.

   Verifiers MUST go through (at least) the following steps before
   trusting/using any of the contents of an SD-JWT:

   1.  Determine if holder binding is to be checked for the SD-JWT.
       Refer to Section 7.6 for details.

   2.  Check that the presentation consists of six period-separated (.)
       elements; if holder binding is not required, the last element can
       be empty.

   3.  Separate the SD-JWT from the HS-Disclosures JWT.

   4.  Validate the SD-JWT:

       1.  Ensure that a signing algorithm was used that was deemed
           secure for the application.  Refer to [RFC8725], Sections 3.1
           and 3.2 for details.

       2.  Validate the signature over the SD-JWT.

       3.  Validate the issuer of the SD-JWT and that the signing key
           belongs to this issuer.

       4.  Check that the SD-JWT is valid using nbf, iat, and exp
           claims, if provided in the SD-JWT.

       5.  Check that the claim sd_digests is present in the SD-JWT.

       6.  Check that the sd_digest_derivation_alg claim is present and
           its value is understand and the digest derivation algorithm
           is deemed secure.

   5.  Validate the HS-Disclosures JWT:

       1.  If holder binding is required, validate the signature over
           the SD-JWT using the same steps as for the SD-JWT plus the
           following steps:

           1.  Determine that the public key for the private key that
               used to sign the HS-Disclosures JWT is bound to the SD-
               JWT, i.e., the SD-JWT either contains a reference to the
               public key or contains the public key itself.

           2.  Determine that the HS-Disclosures JWT is bound to the
               current transaction and was created for this verifier
               (replay protection).  This is usually achieved by a nonce
               and aud field within the HS-Disclosures JWT.

       2.  For each claim in the HS-Disclosures JWT:

           1.  Ensure that the claim is present as well in sd_digests in
               the SD-JWT.  If sd_digests is structured, the claim MUST
               be present at the same place within the structure.

           2.  Compute the base64url-encoded digest of the JSON literal
               disclosed by the Holder using the
               sd_digest_derivation_alg in SD-JWT.

           3.  Compare the digests computed in the previous step with
               the one of the same claim in the SD-JWT.  Accept the
               claim only when the two digests match.

           4.  Ensure that the claim value in the HS-Disclosures JWT is
               a JSON-encoded object containing at least the keys s and
               v, and optionally n.

           5.  Store the value of the key v as the claim value.  If n is
               contained in the object, use the value of the key n as
               the claim name.

       3.  Once all necessary claims have been verified, their values
           can be validated and used according to the requirements of
           the application.  It MUST be ensured that all claims required
           for the application have been disclosured.

   If any step fails, the input is not valid and processing MUST be
   aborted.

6.3.  Processing Model

   Neither an SD-JWT nor an HS-Disclosures JWT is suitable for direct
   use by an application.  Besides the REQUIRED verification steps
   listed above, it is further RECOMMENDED that an application-
   consumable format is generated from the data released in the HS-
   Disclosures.  The RECOMMENDED way is to merge the released claims and
   any plaintext claims in the SD-JWT recursively:

   *  Objects from the released claims must be merged into existing
      objects from the SD-JWT.

   *  If a key is present in both objects:

      -  If the value in the released claims is and object and the value
         in the SD-JWT claims is an object, the two objects MUST be
         merged recursively.

      -  Else, the value in the released claims MUST be used.

   The keys sd_digests and sd_digest_derivation_alg SHOULD be removed
   prior to further processing.

   The processing is shown in Examples 2b and 3 in the Appendix.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Mandatory digest computation of the revealed claim values by the
      Verifier

   ToDo: add text explaining mechanisms that should be adopted to ensure
   that verifiers validate the claim values received in HS-Disclosures
   JWT by calculating the digests of those values and comparing them
   with the digests in the SD-JWT: - create a test suite that forces
   digest computation by the Verifiers, and includes negative test cases
   in test vectors - use only implementations/libraries that are
   compliant to the test suite - etc.

7.2.  Mandatory signing of the SD-JWT

   The SD-JWT MUST be signed by the issuer to protect integrity of the
   issued claims.  An attacker can modify or add claims if an SD-JWT is
   not signed (e.g., change the "email" attribute to take over the
   victim's account or add an attribute indicating a fake academic
   qualification).

   The verifier MUST always check the SD-JWT signature to ensure that
   the SD-JWT has not been tampered with since its issuance.  If the
   signature on the SD-JWT cannot be verified, the SD-JWT MUST be
   rejected.

7.3.  Entropy of the salt

   The security model relies on the fact that the salt is not learned or
   guessed by the attacker.  It is vitally important to adhere to this
   principle.  As such, the salt MUST be created in such a manner that
   it is cryptographically random, long enough and has high entropy that
   it is not practical for the attacker to guess.  A new salt MUST be
   chosen for each claim.

7.4.  Minimum length of the salt

   The RECOMMENDED length of the randomly-generated portion of the salt
   is at least 128 bits.

   Note that minimum 128 bits would be necessary when SHA-256, HMAC-
   SHA256, or a function of similar strength is used, but a smaller salt
   size might achieve similar level of security if a stronger iterative
   derivation function is used.

7.5.  Choice of a digest derivation algorithm

   For the security of this scheme, the digest derivation algorithm is
   required to be preimage and collision resistant, i.e., it is
   infeasible to calculate the salt and claim value that result in a
   particular digest, and it is infeasible to find a different salt and
   claim value pair that result in a matching digest, respectively.

   Furthermore the hash algorithms MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-160, and SHA-1
   revealed fundamental weaknesses and they MUST NOT be used.

7.6.  Holder Binding

   TBD

7.7.  Blinding Claim Names

   Issuers that chose to blind claim names MUST ensure not to
   inadvertently leak information about the blinded claim names to
   verifiers.  In particular, issuers MUST choose placeholder claim
   names accordingly.

   It is RECOMMENDED to use cryptographically salts with at least 128
   bits of entropy as placeholder claim names.

   The order of elements in JSON-encoded objects is not relevant to
   applications, but the order may reveal information about the blinded
   claim name to the verifier.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED to ensure
   that the claims in the SD-JWT, II-Disclosures object, and HS-
   Disclosures JWT is shuffled or otherwise hidden, e.g., by
   alphabetically sorting using the blinded claim names.

8.  Privacy Considerations

8.1.  Claim Names

   By default, claim names are not blinded in an SD-JWT.  In this case,
   even when the claim's value is not known to a verifier, the claim
   name can disclose some information to the verifier.  For example, if
   the SD-JWT contains a claim named super_secret_club_membership_no,
   the verifier might assume that the end-user is a member of the Super
   Secret Club.

   Blinding claim names can help to avoid this potential privacy issue.
   In many cases, however, verifiers can already deduce this or similar
   information just from the identification of the issuer and the schema
   used for the SD-JWT.  Blinding claim names might not provide
   additional privacy if this is the case.

   Furthermore, re-using the same value to blind a claim name may limit
   the privacy benefits.

8.2.  Unlinkability

   Colluding issuer/verifier or verifier/verifier pairs could link
   issuance/presentation or two presentation sessions to the same user
   on the basis of unique values encoded in the SD-JWT (issuer
   signature, salts, digests, etc.).  More advanced cryptographic
   schemes, outside the scope of this specification, can be used to
   prevent this type of linkability.

A.1.  Example 2a - Structured SD-JWT

   This non-normative example is based on the same claim values as
   Example 1, but this time the issuer decided to create a structured
   object for the digests.  This allows for the disclosure of individual
   members of the address claim separately.

       }
     }
   }

A.2.  Example 2b - Mixing SD and Non-SD Claims

   In this example, a variant of Example 2a, the issuer decided to apply
   selective disclosure only to some of the claims.  In particular, the
   country component of the address is contained in the JWT as a regular
   claim, whereas the rest of the claims can be disclosed selectively.
   Note that the processing model described in Section 6.3 allows for
   merging the selectively disclosable claims with the regular claims.

   The JSON-payload of the SD-JWT that contains both selectively
   disclosable claims in the sd_digests object and not selectively
   disclosable claims in a top-level JWT claim would look as follows:

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",

           "xnnXv6CdbA7W32QFVR7EJR8HUSPve-BctZB8fQeQY3w",
         "locality": "oTEeEDiZ_w6RieLd-upFz3uAjhmbt_PJWCB2SmQqch8",
         "region": "IQI47wPHBkSQ6SGQrbAeCc-YfvfCtrKzOXEf76Un-JI",
         "country": "A6uzBmWsTYOHryTvu525qMsye0KjL7Ana1JAfIRqLjQ"
       },
       "birthdate": "3CT30sE4eEQH5QFeZvkUmwphHrnEwrY1DVkQ1BAIr7E"
     },
     "address": {
       "country": "US"
     }
   }

   The holder can now, for example, release the rest of the components
   of the address claim in the HS-Disclosures:

   {
     "nonce": "XZOUco1u_gEPknxS78sWWg",
     "aud": "https://example.com/verifier",
     "sd_hs_disclosures": {
       "given_name": "{\"s\": \"44PE8SYm3Mg7kqxua_ftyw\", \"v\":
         \"John\"}",
       "family_name": "{\"s\": \"DBcSkeRQqVkPfTyNNWSkbA\", \"v\":
         \"Doe\"}",
       "birthdate": "{\"s\": \"nIiX9JVD9JYCPBlYcIrukA\", \"v\":
         \"1940-01-01\"}",
       "address": {
         "region": "{\"s\": \"XtnSYJPrsh_ShvklQhbDgQ\", \"v\":
           \"Anystate\"}",
         "street_address": "{\"s\": \"hP_dhW14jiTijaQZOOFvUw\", \"v\":
           \"123 Main St\"}",
         "locality": "{\"s\": \"9678ZRsZ5nwcWmU_wIqKFg\", \"v\":
           \"Anytown\"}"
       }
     }
   }

   The verifier, after verifying the SD-JWT and applying the HS-
   Disclosures, would process the result according to Section 6.3 and
   pass the following data to the application:

   {
     "given_name": "John",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
     "address": {
       "region": "Anystate",

A.3.  Example 3 - Complex Structured SD-JWT

   In this example, a complex object such as those used for OIDC4IDA
   (todo reference) is used.

   In this example, the Issuer is using a following object as a set of
   selectively disclosable claims to issue to the Holder:

   {
     "verified_claims": {
       "verification": {
         "trust_framework": "de_aml",
         "time": "2012-04-23T18:25Z",
         "verification_process": "f24c6f-6d3f-4ec5-973e-b0d8506f3bc7",
         "evidence": [
           {
             "type": "document",
             "method": "pipp",
             "time": "2012-04-22T11:30Z",
             "document": {
               "type": "idcard",
               "issuer": {
                 "name": "Stadt Augsburg",
                 "country": "DE"
               },
               "number": "53554554",
               "date_of_issuance": "2010-03-23",
               "date_of_expiry": "2020-03-22"
             }
           }
         ]
       },
       "claims": {
         "given_name": "Max",
         "family_name": "Meier",
         "nationalities": [
           "DE"
         ],
         "address": {
           "locality": "Maxstadt",
           "postal_code": "12344",
           "country": "DE",
           "street_address": "An der Weide 22"
         }
       }
     },
     "birth_middle_name": "Timotheus",
     "salutation": "Dr.",
     "msisdn": "49123456789"
   }

   The issuer in this example further adds the two claims birthdate and
   place_of_birth to the claims element in plain text.  The following
   shows the resulting SD-JWT payload:

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com/issuer",
     "cnf": {
       "jwk": {
         "kty": "RSA",

   The SD-JWT is then signed by the issuer to create a document like the
   following:

   A HS-Disclosures JWT for some of the claims may look as follows:

   {
     "nonce": "XZOUco1u_gEPknxS78sWWg",
     "aud": "https://example.com/verifier",
     "sd_hs_disclosures": {
       "verified_claims": {
         "verification": {
           "trust_framework": "{\"s\": \"SJKr-Pydh8RqHomXCOiVwQ\",
             \"v\": \"de_aml\"}",
           "time": "{\"s\": \"CrxH2Ez8uu2t7tEPQqwZig\", \"v\":
             \"2012-04-23T18:25Z\"}",
           "evidence": [
             {
               "type": "{\"s\": \"sPCCbZtOdjnQjfOiPBxOYA\", \"v\":
                 \"document\"}"
             }
           ]
         },
         "claims": {
           "given_name": "{\"s\": \"kqwnbB6oHhaBD3F3t-KUGw\", \"v\":
             \"Max\"}",
           "family_name": "{\"s\": \"_6Do5glcgEQDMVJoPArGSA\", \"v\":
             \"Meier\"}"
         }
       }
     }
   }

   After verifying the SD-JWT and HS-Disclosures, the verifier merges
   the selectively disclosed claims into the other data contained in the
   JWT.  The verifier will then pass the result on to the application
   for further processing:

   {
     "verified_claims": {
       "verification": {
         "trust_framework": "de_aml",
         "time": "2012-04-23T18:25Z",
         "evidence": [
           {
             "type": "document"
           }
         ]
       },
       "claims": {

   specification can be represented using W3C Verifiable Credentials
   Data Model as defined in [VC_DATA].

   SD-JWT is equivalent to an issuer-signed W3C Verifiable Credential
   (VC).  II-Disclosures Object is sent alongside a VC.

   HS-Disclosures JWT is equivalent to a holder-signed W3C Verifiable
   Presentation (VP).

   HS-Disclosures JWT as a VP contains a verifiableCredential claim
   inside a vp claim that is a string array of an SD-JWT as a VC using
   JWT compact serialization.

   Below is a non-normative example of an SD-JWT represented as a
   verifiable credential encoded as JSON and signed as JWS compliant to
   [VC_DATA].

   II-Disclosures Object sent alongside this SD-JWT as a JWT-VC is same
   as in Example 1.

Appendix B.  Blinding Claim Names

B.1.  Example 5: Some Blinded Claims

   The following shows the user information used in this example,
   included a claim named secret_club_membership_no:

   {
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "given_name": "John",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "email": "johndoe@example.com",
     "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
     "secret_club_membership_no": "23",
     "other_secret_club_membership_no": "42",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "123 Main St",
       "locality": "Anytown",
       "region": "Anystate",
       "country": "US"
     },
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01"
   }

   Hiding just this claim, the SD-JWT payload shown in the following
   would result.  Note that the claims are sorted alphabetically as
   described in Section 7.7.

     }
   }

   In the II-Disclosures Object, it can be seen that the blinded claim's
   original name is secret_club_membership_no.  Note that the claims are
   sorted alphabetically as described in Section 7.7.

   {
     "sd_ii_disclosures": {
       "HS4QoeE9ty-I8BZTEupSzw": "{\"s\": \"iq6rolXF0SyWSsdCeaETNg\",
         \"v\": \"23\", \"n\": \"secret_club_membership_no\"}",

       },
       "birthdate": "{\"s\": \"OErzfd2Gy6jw1atlcCpr6A\", \"v\":

       "email": "{\"s\": \"woZIMokulfwyF_do1czRaA\", \"v\":

       "family_name": "{\"s\": \"ZXPEdf3K8mtRBKDAMjEcBQ\", \"v\":

       "given_name": "{\"s\": \"btsLJCwSb0B7gtVLPMjjqA\", \"v\":

         \"6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c\"}"
     }
   }

   The verifier would learn this information via the HS-Disclosures JWT:

   {
     "nonce": "XZOUco1u_gEPknxS78sWWg",
     "aud": "https://example.com/verifier",
     "sd_hs_disclosures": {
       "given_name": "{\"s\": \"btsLJCwSb0B7gtVLPMjjqA\", \"v\":

       "birthdate": "{\"s\": \"OErzfd2Gy6jw1atlcCpr6A\", \"v\":

         \"v\": \"23\", \"n\": \"secret_club_membership_no\"}"
     }
   }

   The verifier would decode the data as follows:

   {
     "given_name": "John",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01",
     "address": {
       "region": "Anystate",
       "country": "US"
     },
     "secret_club_membership_no": "23"
   }

B.2.  Example 6: All Claim Names Blinded

   In this example, all claim names are blinded.  The following user
   data is used:

   {
     "sub": "6c5c0a49-b589-431d-bae7-219122a9ec2c",
     "given_name": "John",
     "family_name": "Doe",
     "email": "johndoe@example.com",
     "phone_number": "+1-202-555-0101",
     "secret_club_membership_no": "23",
     "address": {
       "street_address": "123 Main St",
       "locality": "Anytown",
       "region": "Anystate",
       "country": "US"
     },
     "birthdate": "1940-01-01"
   }

   The resulting SD-JWT payload:

   }

   Here, the holder decided only to disclose a subset of the claims to
   the verifier:

       }
     }
   }

   The verifier would decode the HS-Disclosures JWT and SD-JWT as
   follows:

Appendix C.  Document History

   [[ To be removed from the final specification ]]

   -01

   *  introduce blinded claim names

   *  explain why JSON-encoding of values is needed

   *  explain merging algorithm ("processing model")

   *  generalized hash alg to digest derivation alg which also enables
      HMAC to calculate digests

   *  sd_digest_derivation_alg renamed to sd_digest_derivation_alg

   *  Salt/Value Container (SVC) renamed to Issuer-Issued Disclosures
      (II-Disclosures)

   *  SD-JWT-Release (SD-JWT-R) renamed to Holder-Selected Disclosures
      (HS-Disclosures)

   *  sd_disclosure in II-Disclosures renamed to sd_ii_disclosures

   *  sd_disclosure in HS-Disclosures renamed to sd_hs_disclosures

   *  clarified relationship between sd_hs_disclosure and SD-JWT

   *  updated examples

   *  text clarifications

   *  fix cnf structure in examples

   -00

   *  Upload as draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-00

   [[ pre Working Group Adoption: ]]

   -02

   *  Added acknowledgements

   *  Improved Security Considerations

   *  Stressed entropy requirements for salts

   *  Python reference implementation clean-up and refactoring

   *  hash_alg renamed to sd_hash_alg

   -01

   *  Editorial fixes

   *  Added hash_alg claim

   *  Renamed _sd to sd_digests and sd_release

   *  Added descriptions on holder binding - more work to do

   *  Clarify that signing the SD-JWT is mandatory

   -00

   *  Renamed to SD-JWT (focus on JWT instead of JWS since signature is
      optional)

   *  Make holder binding optional

   *  Rename proof to release, since when there is no signature, the
      term "proof" can be misleading

   *  Improved the structure of the description

   *  Described verification steps

   *  All examples generated from python demo implementation

   *  Examples for structured objects
